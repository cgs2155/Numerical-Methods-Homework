My homework assignments for APMA 4300: Introduction to Numerical Methods taken in Fall 2022

Course Summary:
 Introduction to fundamental algorithms and analysis of numerical methods commonly used by scientists,
 mathematicians and engineers. Designed to give a fundamental understanding of the building blocks of 
 scientific computing that will be used in more advanced courses in scientific computing and numerical 
 methods for PDEs (e.g. APMA E4301, E4302). Topics include numerical solutions of algebraic systems,
 linear least-squares, eigenvalue problems, solution of non-linear systems, optimization, interpolation,
 numerical integration and differentiation, initial value problems and boundary value problems for systems of ODEs.
